# ðŸ“– Concept Plan  

## Project Title  
**Sales and Inventory System with QR Code-Based Ordering and Predictive Analytics**  

---

## Overview  
This system is designed for small restaurants to simplify and modernize their operations. Customers can place orders by scanning a **QR code**, while cashiers can handle traditional counter orders. The system updates the inventory in real time, manages sales and payments, and uses predictive analytics to forecast demand based on historical data.

- Order is automatically saved in the system.  

### 2. Cashier-Assisted Ordering

### 4. Inventory & Menu Management  
- Admin manages menu items (add, update, delete).  
- Product details stored   
- Inventory auto-updates whenever orders are placed.  

### 5. Predictive Analytics  
- Uses **time-series regression models** to forecast sales.  
- Provides insights such as peak hours, best sellers, and demand trends.  
- Helps prevent stockouts and overstocking.  

### 6. Audit Trail & Security  
- All user actions (login, menu update, order status change) are logged.
